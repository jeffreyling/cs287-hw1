\section{Introduction}

Text classification and sentiment analysis is an old problem with applications ranging from business analytics to finance.
It is an easy task for humans to tell whether a piece of writing pertaining to some topic speaks positively or negatively about that topic. 
For example, we know immediately that a movie review containing the phrase ``worst movie ever'' is extremely negative, while the opposite phrase 
``best movie ever'' indicates an extremely positive review. We are also capable of easily parsing more high-level semantic features such as context and sarcasm.

This problem is much more difficult for a computer that cannot naively detect things such as context and sarcasm. However, we can construct supervised learning algorithms that 
can be used to train good estimators of text sentiment. 

In this paper, we explore three methods of classifying the sentiment of movie reviews from the Stanford Sentiment database. These three methods are Naive Bayes, 
logistic regression with L2 regularization, and hinge-loss linear SVM with L2 regularization. 

In Section $2$, we introduce our notation and give a description of our problem in formal language. In Section $3$, we describe our three algorithms as implementations of 
the probabilistic linear model. In Section $4$, we present our experimental results for hyperparameter tuning and algorithm performance. In Section $5$, we conclude with a 
discussion of our results. 

\section{Problem Description}

In general, homeworks will be specified using informal
language. As part of the assignment, we expect you to write-out a
definition of the problem and your model in formal language. For this
class, we will use the following notation:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\boldb, \boldm$;  bold letters for vectors.
\item $\boldB, \boldM$;  bold capital letters for matrices.
\item $\mcB, \mcM$;  script-case for sets.
\item $b_i, x_i$; lower case for scalars or indexing into vectors.
\end{itemize}


For instance in natural language processing, it is common to use
discrete sets like $\mcV$ for the vocabulary of the language, or $\mcT$ for a
tag set of the language.  We might also want one-hot vectors
representing words. These will be of the type
$\boldv \in \{0,1\}^{|\mcV|}$. In a note, it is crucial to define the
types of all variables that are introduced. The problem description is the
right place to do this.

% NLP is also
% full of sequences. For instance sentences, $w_1, \ldots, w_N$, where
% here $N$ is a constant length and $w_i \in \mcV$ for all
% $i \in \{1, \ldots N\}$. If we pretend sentences are all the same
% length, we can have scoring function over sentences,
% $s : \mcV^N \mapsto \reals$.  One might be defined as:

% \[ s(w_1, \ldots, w_N) = \sum_{i = 1}^N p(w_i | w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}), \]

% \noindent where $p$ is the bigram probability, which we will cover later in the class.

\section{Model and Algorithms}

Here you specify the model itself. This section should formally
describe the model used to solve the task proposed in the previous
section. This section should try to avoid introducing new vocabulary
or notation, when possible use the notation from the previous section.
Feel free to use the notation from class, but try to make the note
understandable as a standalone piece of text.

This section is also a great place to include other material that
describes the underlying structure and choices of your model, for
instance here are some example tables and algorithms from full
research papers:



\begin{itemize}
\item diagrams of your model,

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{network}
  \end{center}
\item feature tables,

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
      \toprule
      &\multicolumn{2}{c}{Mention Features  } \\
      & Feature & Value Set\\
      \midrule
      & Mention Head & $\mcV$ \\
      & Mention First Word & $\mcV$ \\
      & Mention Last Word & $\mcV$ \\
      & Word Preceding Mention & $\mcV$ \\
      & Word Following Mention & $\mcV$\\
      & \# Words in Mention & $\{1, 2, \ldots \}$ \\
      & Mention Type & $\mathcal{T}$ \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\item pseudo-code,

  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Linearize}{$x_1\ldots x_N$, $K$, $g$}
    \State{$B_0 \gets \langle (\langle \rangle, \{1, \ldots, N\}, 0, \boldh_0, \mathbf{0})  \rangle$}
    \For{$m = 0, \ldots, M-1$ }
    \For{$k = 1, \ldots, |B_m|$}
    \For{$i \in \mcR$}
    \State{$(y, \mcR, s, \boldh) \gets \mathrm{copy}(B_m^{(k)})$}
    \For{word $w$ in phrase $x_i$}
    \State{$y \gets y $ append $w$ }
    \State{$s \gets s + \log q(w, \boldh) $ }
    \State{$\boldh \gets \delta(w, \boldh)$}
    \EndFor{}
    \State{$B_{m+|w_i|} \gets B_{m+|w_i|} + (y, \mcR - i, s,   \boldh)$}
    \State{keep top-$K$ of $B_{m+|w_i|}$ by $f(x, y) + g(\mcR)$}
    \EndFor{}
    \EndFor{}
    \EndFor{}
    \State{\Return{$B_{M}^{(k)}$}}
    \EndProcedure{}
  \end{algorithmic}

\end{itemize}


\section{Experiments}

Finally we end with the experimental section. Each assignment will make clear the main experiments and baselines that you should run. For these experiments you should present a main results table. Here we give a sample Table~\ref{tab:results}. In addition to these results you should describe in words what the table shows and the relative performance of the models.

Besides the main results we will also ask you to present other results
comparing particular aspects of the models. For instance, for word
embedding experiments, we may ask you to show a chart of the projected
word vectors. This experiment will lead to something like
Figure~\ref{fig:clusters}. This should also be described within the
body of the text itself.


\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{llr}
 \toprule
 Model &  & Acc. \\
 \midrule
 \textsc{Baseline 1} & & 0.45\\
 \textsc{Baseline 2} & & 2.59 \\
 \textsc{Model 1} & & 10.59  \\
 \textsc{Model 2} & &13.42 \\
 \textsc{Model 3} & & 7.49\\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:results} Table with the main results.}

\section{Conclusion}

End the write-up with a very short recap of the main experiments and the main results. Describe any challenges you may have faced, and what could have been improved in the model.
